# MoviesDb-Android-Example


This app is a Upcoming Movies List to demonstrate the usage of:
- Hilt
- Retrofit2
- Paging
- Navigation

I also use the YouTube player for Android, you can download it from [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/downloads).

In this app we consume [TheMoviesDb v3](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) API, further I'll be creating a version with [TheMoviesDb v4](https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/getting-started) :grin:.

UI and UX could improve a lot :sweat_smile:, but I'm not a designer.
